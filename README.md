# Intelligent Systems Project Documentation

## Introduction

Intelligent Systems are computer programs that exhibit characteristics and behaviors comparable to human or animal intelligence. This definition serves as a guiding principle for this project. Among the most prominent and widely used algorithms in the field of intelligent systems or artificial intelligence are genetic algorithms. These algorithms evolve a population of individuals through random actions similar to those observed in biological evolution (genetic mutations and recombinations), as well as through selection based on some criteria that determines which individuals are more adapted and survive, and which are less fit and discarded.

## Problem Description

The problem to be solved in this project is the optimization of functions known as artificial landscapes, which are useful for evaluating the performance of genetic algorithms.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to test various features of genetic algorithms in order to determine how different methods of crossover, mutation, selection, replacement, etc. affect different problems and identify which parameters are best suited for each situation. The goal is to locate the minimum of each of the proposed functions using genetic algorithms.

### Functions to Optimize

1. Rastrigin Function:

The Rastrigin function is defined as follows:

f(x1, x2, ..., xn) = An + sum((xi^2 - Acos(2pixi)), i=1 to n)

where A = 10 and n = 3. The variables xi are bounded by -5.12 and 5.12, and the global minimum occurs at (x1, x2, ..., xn) = (0, 0, ..., 0) with a function value of 0.

2. Ackley Function:

The Ackley function is defined as follows:

f(x, y) = -20exp(-0.2sqrt(0.5*(x^2 + y^2))) - exp(0.5*(cos(2pix) + cos(2piy))) + e + 20

The variables x and y are bounded by -5 and 5, and the global minimum occurs at (x, y) = (0, 0) with a function value of 0.

3. Beale Function:

The Beale function is defined as follows:

f(x, y) = (1.5 - x + xy^2)^2 + (2.25 - x + xy^2)^2 + (2.625 - x + x*y^3)^2

The variables x and y are bounded by -4.5 and 4.5, and the global minimum occurs at (x, y) = (3, 0.5) with a function value of 0.

4. Bukin Function:

The Bukin function is defined as follows:

f(x, y) = 100sqrt(abs(y - 0.01x^2)) + 0.01*abs(x + 10)


The variables x and y are bounded by -15 and -5, and -3 and 3 respectively. The global minimum occurs at (x, y) = (-10, 1) with a function value of 0.

## Algorithm Parameters

In order to perform a detailed study of the importance of the parameters in a genetic algorithm, the program should allow the user to input the following parameters:

- Population size
- Number of generations
- Crossover probability
- Mutation probability
- Elitism (indicates the number of elite individuals, 0 for no elitism)

The program should also allow the user to select the function to optimize, the replacement strategy, crossover type, mutation type, and selection method as mentioned previously.

The solutions generated by the algorithm should be interpretable by the user, providing a translation from the genotype to the phenotype of the problem.

## Program Implementation

The program will be implemented in Java and will provide a graphical user interface (GUI) whenever possible. The GUI will allow the user to input the algorithm parameters and select the function, replacement strategy, crossover type, mutation type, and selection method. The program will generate a CSV file containing the evolution of the best individual and the population, which can be further analyzed using a data visualization program. Alternatively, the program can display the evolution of the best individual and the population graphically on the screen.

## Conclusion

This project aims to explore the capabilities and behavior of genetic algorithms in solving optimization problems. By implementing a Java program with a user-friendly interface, users can experiment with different algorithm parameters and observe how they affect the optimization process for different functions. The results obtained from this project will contribute to a better understanding of genetic algorithms and their applicability in various domains.
